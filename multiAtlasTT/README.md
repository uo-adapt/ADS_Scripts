# multiAtlasTT (Beta)
_Multi-Atlas Transfer Tools for Neuroimaging (maTT)_

Given a completed FreeSurfer _recon-all_ directoy, these scripts can transfer an atlas (.annot file; also called a 'parcellation') in fsaverage space to subject space, in both volume (nifti) and surface (.annot) format. Therefore, using these tools one can obtain multiple parcellations in the subject space (in addition to the Desikan-Killiany and Destrieux parcellations that recon-all usually constructs<sup>1</sup>). The major part of the label transfer script was adapted from scripts written by the [CJNeuroLab](https://cjneurolab.org/2016/11/22/hcp-mmp1-0-volumetric-nifti-masks-in-native-structural-space/). The goal of these tools is to make fitting multiple atlases a piece of cake. Have fun! 

This project is in *beta*; work is ongoing. Please feel free to comment via issue/pull request.

#### maTT2 update (recommended) 
We have now added functionality to use FreeSurfer [gaussian classifier surface atlas](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/SurfaceLabelAtlas) (.gcs) files to label individual subjects. These files are large, so they are hosted in a Figshare repository here: https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5998583.v1

The gcs files were created by running the Mindboggle 101 brains (http://dx.doi.org/10.7910/DVN/HMQKCK) through FreeSurfer _recon-all_ (versions 5.3 and 6.0) and creating individually labeled atlases using the maTT functionality. For each atlas, we created a gaussian classifer surface atlas using the 101 Mindboggle subjects. We have provided an example script for this creation process (``maTT2_caLabelTrain_example.sh``).

An advantage of using the maTT2 functionality is that it takes much less time. Additionally, the maTT2-derived atlases seem to contain smoother borders between parcellated regions. 

## Prerequities

* FSL
* FreeSurfer
* [easy_lausanne](https://github.com/mattcieslak/easy_lausanne)
  * meaning you have nibabel and numpy too
  * Also, easy_lausanne is a great tool that you should check out!

## Usage

See ``example_run_maTT.sh`` for modifiable example scipt to run maTT. 

See ``example_run_maTT2.sh`` for modifiable example script to run maTT2, which uses gcs files that need to be downloaded from the accompanying [figshare repositroy](https://doi.org/10.6084/m9.figshare.5998583.v1). 

After program completion, resultant file of interested will be called ``${atlas}/${atlas}_rmap.nii.gz`` (rmap stands for re-mapped) which will contain the atlas labels 1:(num labels). 14 Subcortical labels will be added at the end. There will be a filed called ``${atlas}/${atlas}_rmap.nii.gz_remap.txt`` which described how the original label numbers from the FreeSurfer annotation<sup>4</sup> were mapped to this rmap nifti file.

This tool follows the recommendations found [here](https://wiki.humanconnectome.org/display/PublicData/HCP+Users+FAQ#HCPUsersFAQ-9.HowdoImapdatabetweenFreeSurferandHCP?) using the [8may2017](http://brainvis.wustl.edu/workbench/standard_mesh_atlases_8may2017.zip) data. _Note_: this hcp-mmp-b atlas does not have '???' regions for the left and right hemis, wheresas the hcp-mmp atlas does. This affects the final node label indices in the rmap files. Also, the color LUT of the hcp-mmp-b is slightly different.

  * We transformed the Arslan data, which is fs_LR 32k space, to fsaverage space, and then made .annot files in this space. For these data, we created arbitrary parcel names and LUT files. The LUT files here seem to have some weirdness in them regarding hemisphere assignments. Thus, these atlases are provided as a means to slice up the cortex. The names and correspondences of the LUT should be determined independently; *not* based on the LUT files provided here.

Note that the atlases here are not a comprehensive set of the parcellations used in neuroimaging. If you would like to see another parcellation (in fsaverage space) supported here, feel free to post an issue/pull request! 

Also note that fitting a parcellation in the manner used here is not the only method for fitting parcellations to neuroimage data. While these tools warp an 'average' brain to each subject, some methods compute individualized parcellations based on subject-level data. 

<sup>1</sup> These tools transfer the atlas from fsaverage to subject space using [_mri_label2label_](https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/fswiki/mri_label2label), whereas FreeSufer _recon-all_ uses _mris_ca_label_ to generative the Desikan and Destrieux parcellations in native space. This tool can be used as part of a pipeline to generate the appropriate .gcs files necessary for potentially using the _mris_ca_train_ and _mris_ca_label_ functions.

<sup>2</sup> The creators of the HCP-MMP1.0 atlas [do not fully support](https://www.mail-archive.com/hcp-users@humanconnectome.org/msg03072.html) transfering their parcellation to volume space. This is because the HCP altas is supposed to be fit with multiple imaging modalities, multi-modal surface matching, and a perceptron; on a high resolution surface. These tools only utilize the FreeSurfer surface registration. Therefore, proceed at your own risk. See also [this preprint](https://www.biorxiv.org/content/early/2018/01/29/255620) for additional info on the HCP viewpoint.

<sup>3</sup> The yeo17 atlas used here is the subdivided 17 atlas, which contains 57 nodes per hemisphere. This atlas was originally in fsaverage5 space, but we have upsampled it to fsaverage space. Note that gaps exist between atlas regions; these gaps are labeled as intensities 1 and 59 for the left and right hemisphere respectively. 

<sup>4</sup> Note that the FreeSurfer annotation adds 1000 to values of the left hemisphere and 2000 to values of the right hemisphere. In the output folder, there will also be a non-rmap'ed file saved, for reference.
