.. _regress:

``regress``
============

``regress`` executes multiple linear regression to fit any confound time series computed using the
``confound`` module to the time series of each voxel in the analyte image. Any variance in the BOLD
time series that is explained by the confound model is discarded from the analyte image. The
residuals (unexplained variance) of the BOLD time series are retained as the denoised image.
``regress`` additionally supports temporal filtering, censoring, and production of smoothed
derivative time series.

Despiking
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Despiking is a process in which large spikes in the BOLD times series are truncated. Despiking
reduces/limits the  amplitude or magnitude of the large spikes but preserves those data points
with an imputed reduced amplitude.  Despiking is encouraged to be done before filtering and
regression to minimize the impact  of spike. Despiking is very effective because it is a voxelwise
operation, and no volume is deleted/removed.  For despiking in xcpEngine, ``DSP`` is added to
``regress_process``::

 regress_process[cxt]=DSP-TMP-REG

.. _censoring:

Temporal Censoring
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Temporal Censoring is a process in which data points with excessive motion outliers are identified/flaggeg.
The censored data points are removed from the data. This is effective for removing spurious sources of connectivity
in fMRI data but must be applied verycarefully because the censored volumes are removed and the final BOLD signal.
To apply censoring in xcpEngine, ``confound2_censor[cxt]=1`` should be specified in ``confound2``
in the design file.  However, the threshold to identify the censored volumes or outliers is obtained
from framewise displacement. The framewise displacement (FD) is obtained from ``FMRIPREP`` regressors.

Framewise displacement (fd) will be used as the threshold. For Instance, the spike regression (Satterthwaite et al. 2013)
required threshold of 0.25mm for TR of 3s and Scrubbing (Power 2012) required threshold of 0.5 mm. Any volume wiht fd above the
threshold will be flagged. The threshold is congigure  in `confound2` as shown below::
point will be flagged. Scrubbing/censoring uses FD,RMS and dvars to established the threshold.  The
threshold is specified in ``confound2`` as well as

  * ``confound2_framewise[cxt]=fds:0.083,dv:2``. For spike regression, with TR of of 3,  the threshold will be
  0.083\*3 ~= 0.25mm.  with  This is standard or common threshold (Ciric et al. 2012, Satterthwaite et al. 2013)
  and  are provided in the design files. The actual threshold value is determined by the TR of the BOLD signal.

For Scrubbing, the threshold will be `fds:0.167` which implies that the actual threshold will be 0.167\*3 =~0.5mm
Scrubbing also include masking out the contigious volume of more than 5. This can configure by setting::
    *confound2_censor_contig[cxt]=1



``regress_process``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
Specifies the order for execution of filtering and regression. Bandpass filtering the analyte time
series but not nuisance regressors re-introduces noise-related variance at removed frequencies when
the time series is residualised with respect to the regressors via linear fit (Hallquist et al.,
2014). Thus, effective denoising requires either that confound regression be performed prior to
temporal filtering or that both the analyte time series and all confound time series be subjected
to the same temporal filter in order to prevent frequency mismatch.
Format ``regress_process`` as a string of concatenated three-character routine codes separated by
hyphens (``-``).

  * ``REG-TMP`` instructs the module to perform confound regression prior to temporal filtering.
  * ``TMP-REG`` instructs the module to perform temporal filtering prior to confound regression.
    If this option is set, then both the analyte time series and all confound time series will be
    filtered.
    This option is typically preferable to ``REG-TMP`` because it determines the confound fit using
    only the frequencies of interest.
  * Note that censoring is always performed *after* both filtering and regression.


``regress_tmpf``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
*Temporal filtering parameters.*

Bandpass filtering the analyte time series but not nuisance regressors re-introduces noise-related
variance at removed frequencies when the time series is residualised with respect to the regressors
via linear fit (Hallquist et al., 2014). (The XCP Engine is designed so as to make this involuntary
reintroduction of noise impossible.) Instead, the recommended approach is filtering both the time
series and the nuisance regressors immediately prior to fitting and residualisation (Hallquist et
al., 2014).::

  # Gaussian filter
  regress_tmpf[cxt]=gaussian

  # FFT filter
  regress_tmpf[cxt]=fft

  # Second-order Butterworth filter
  regress_tmpf[cxt]=butterworth
  regress_tmpf_order[cxt]=2
  regress_tmpf_pass[cxt]=2

  # First-order Chebyshev I filter with pass-band ripple 0.5
  regress_tmpf[cxt]=chebyshev1
  regress_tmpf_order[cxt]=1
  regress_tmpf_pass[cxt]=2
  regress_tmpf_ripple[cxt]=0.5

  # First-order elliptic filter with pass-band ripple 0.5 and stop-band ripple 20
  regress_tmpf[cxt]=elliptic
  regress_tmpf_order[cxt]=1
  regress_tmpf_pass[cxt]=2
  regress_tmpf_ripple[cxt]=0.5
  regress_tmpf_ripple2[cxt]=20

To note:

 * *FFT*-based filters, as implemented in AFNI's ``3dBandpass``, use a fast Fourier transform to
   attenuate frequencies. An FFT-based filter may not be suitable for use in designs that
   incorporate iterative motion censoring, since it will include interpolated frequencies in its
   calculations.
 * A *Gaussian* filter, as implemented in FSL, uses a Gaussian-weighted least-squares fit to
   remove frequencies of no interest from the data. This filter has a very slow frequency roll-off.
 * *Chebyshev* and *elliptic* filters more ideally discriminate accepted and attenuated
   frequencies than do *Butterworth* filters, but they introduce ripples in either the passband
   (Chebyshev I), stopband (Chebyshev II), or both (elliptic) that result in some signal
   distortion.
 * ``regress*tmpf*order`` specifies the filter order. (Relevant only for Butterworth, Chebyshev,
   and elliptic filters.)
 * ``regress*tmpf*pass`` specifies whether the filter is forward-only
   (``regress*tmpf*pass[cxt]=1``, analogous to ``filter`` or ``lfilter`` in NumPy or MATLAB) or
   forward-and-reverse (``regress*tmpf*pass[cxt]=2``, analogous to ``filtfilt`` in NumPy or
   MATLAB, recommended). (Relevant only for Butterworth, Chebyshev, and elliptic filters.)
 * ``regress*tmpf*ripple`` specifies the pass-band ripple, while ``regress*tmpf*ripple2``
   specifies the stop-band ripple. (``ripple`` relevant only for Chebyshev I or elliptic filter,
   ``ripple2`` relevant only for Chebyshev II or elliptic filter.)


``regress_hipass`` and ``regress_lopass``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

*Temporal filter cutoff frequencies.*

Any frequencies below the low-pass cutoff and above the high-pass cutoff will be counted as
pass-band frequencies; these will be retained by the filter when it is applied.

Functional connectivity between regions of interest is typically determined on the basis of
synchrony in low-frequency fluctuations (Biswal et al., 1995); therefore, removing higher
frequencies using a low-pass filter may effectively remove noise from the time series while
retaining signal of interest. For a contrasting view, see Boubela et al. (2013). Set
``regress_lopass`` to ``n`` (Nyquist) to allow all low frequencies to pass.::

  # Band-pass filter with pass-band 0.01-0.08 Hz
  regress_hipass[cxt]=0.01
  regress_lopass[cxt]=0.08

  # High-pass-only filter (>0.01 Hz)
  regress_hipass[cxt]=0.01
  regress_lopass[cxt]=n

  # Low-pass-only filter (<0.1 Hz)
  regress_hipass[cxt]=0
  regress_lopass[cxt]=0.1

High-pass filters can be used to remove very-low-frequency drift from an acquisition; this is a
form of scanner noise. The demean/detrend option additionally removes linear and polynomial drift.
Set ``regress_hipass`` to 0 to allow all high frequencies to pass.

``regress_sptf`` and ``regress_smo``: Spatial smoothing parameters.
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Endemic noise, for instance due to physiological signals or scanner activity, can introduce
spurious or artefactual results in single voxels. The effects of noise-related artefacts can be
mitigated by spatially filtering the data, thus dramatically increasing the signal-to-noise ratio.
However, spatial smoothing is not without its costs: it effectively reduces volumetric resolution
by blurring signals from adjacent voxels. The spatial smoothing implemented in the ``regress``
module (i) keeps the unsmoothed analyte image for downstream use and (ii) creates a derivative
image that is smoothed using the specified kernel. This allows either the smoothed or the
unsmoothed version of the image to be used in any downstream modules as appropriate.::

  # No smoothing
  regress_sptf[cxt]=none
  regress_smo[cxt]=0

  # Gaussian kernel (fslmaths) of FWHM 6 mm
  regress_sptf[cxt]=gaussian
  regress_smo[cxt]=6

  # SUSAN kernel (FSL's SUSAN) of FWHM 4 mm
  regress_sptf[cxt]=susan
  regress_smo[cxt]=4

  # Uniform kernel (AFNI's 3dBlurToFWHM) of FWHM 5 mm
  regress_sptf[cxt]=uniform
  regress_smo[cxt]=5

``regress_sptf`` specifies the type of spatial filter to apply for smoothing, while ``regress_smo``
specifies the full-width at half-maximum (FWHM) of the smoothing kernel in mm.

 * Gaussian smoothing applies the same Gaussian smoothing kernel across the entire volume.
 * SUSAN-based smoothing restricts mixing of signals from disparate tissue classes
   (Smith and Brady, 1997).
 * Uniform smoothing applies smoothing to all voxels until the smoothness computed at every voxel
   attains the target value.
 * Uniform smoothing may be used as a compensatory mechanism to reduce the effects of subject
   motion on the final processed image (Scheinost et al., 2014).


``regress_rerun``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ordinarily, each module will detect whether a particular analysis has run to completion before
beginning it. If re-running is disabled, then the module will immediately skip to the next stage of
analysis. Otherwise, any completed analyses will be repeated.If you change the run parameters, you
should rerun any modules downstream of the change.::

  # Skip processing steps if the pipeline detects the expected output
  regress_rerun[cxt]=0

  # Repeat all processing steps
  regress_rerun[cxt]=1


``regress_cleanup``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Modules often produce numerous intermediate temporary files and images during the course of an
analysis. In many cases, these temporary files are undesirable and unnecessarily consume disk
space. If cleanup is enabled, any files stamped as temporary will be deleted when a module
successfully runs to completion. If a module fails to detect the output that it expects, then
temporary files will be retained to facilitate error diagnosis.::

  # Remove temporary files
  regress_cleanup[cxt]=1

  # Retain temporary files
  regress_cleanup[cxt]=0


Expected outputs
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The main output of ``regress`` module is ``prefix_residualised.nii.gz`` for the completion of the
module. Other outputs include::
 -  prefix_confmat.1D  # filtered regressors
 -  prefix_confcor.txt # Pearson correlation between confound regressors

For Censoring and spike regression and if any volume is flagged, the other outputs include::

 - prefix_uncensored.nii.gz # the regressed bold image with  flagged volme  interpolated
 - prefix_nVolumesCensored.txt # number of volume censored
 - prefix_residualised.nii.gz # residualized volume with deleted flagged volume

The optional output is the spatially smoothed residualised BOLD signal. This is specified with
``regress_sptf[cxt]`` and ``regress_smo[cxt]`` as explained previously. For instance, with::

  regress_sptf[cxt]=gaussian
  regress_smo[cxt]=6

This tells xcpEngine to smooth the residualised image with gaussian filter and kernel of 6mm. The derived
output, which is saved in the ``regress`` folder, will be::
  prefix_img_sm6.nii.gz
