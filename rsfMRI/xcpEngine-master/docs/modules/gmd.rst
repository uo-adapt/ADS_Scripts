``gmd``
=========

``gmd`` computes a voxelwise grey matter density map [based on previous work by Dr. Stathis
Gennatas and colleagues](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28432144). Grey matter density is
loosely defined as the probability that each voxel is a part of the grey matter as determined using
an iterative, priorless segmentation in ANTs Atropos.

The ``gmd`` module is operational but not configurable.

``gmd_rerun``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Ordinarily, each module will detect whether a particular analysis has run to completion before
beginning it. If re-running is disabled, then the module will immediately skip to the next stage of
analysis. Otherwise, any completed analyses will be repeated.If you change the run parameters, you
should rerun any modules downstream of the change.::

  # Skip processing steps if the pipeline detects the expected output
  gmd_rerun[cxt]=0

  # Repeat all processing steps
  gmd_rerun[cxt]=1

``gmd_cleanup``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Modules often produce numerous intermediate temporary files and images during the course of an
analysis. In many cases, these temporary files are undesirable and unnecessarily consume disk
space. If cleanup is enabled, any files stamped as temporary will be deleted when a module
successfully runs to completion. If a module fails to detect the output that it expects, then
temporary files will be retained to facilitate error diagnosis.::

  # Remove temporary files
  gmd_cleanup[cxt]=1

  # Retain temporary files
  gmd_cleanup[cxt]=0

``Expected outputs``
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
The expected outputs from `gmd` include the following::
 - prefix_probabilityCSF.nii.gz  # CSF probability map
 - prefix_probabilityGM.nii.gz   # grey matter probability map
 - prefix_probabilityWM.nii.gz  # white matter probability map
 - prefix_raw.nii.gz   # raw image 
 - prefix_segmentation3class.nii.gz  # 3-class tissue segmentation
