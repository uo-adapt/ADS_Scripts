Functional connectivity streams
================================

The XCP system includes 6 standard processing streams for functional connectivity. These base
processing streams are summarized below. All processing streams draw on FSL, AFNI, and ANTs. Base
processing streams can be modified at will to suit the dataset that is to be processed. Consult
module documentation for additional details.

Subject movement introduces a substantial amount of spurious variance into the BOLD signal; if data
processing fails to account for the influence of motion-related variance, then artefact may
subsequently be misconstrued as effect of interest. Accordingly, a number of high-performing
processing streams for removing motion artefact are made available in the XCP system. Three
families of denoising streams are available:

 * High-parameter streams (`36P`) combine frame-to-frame motion estimates, mean signals from white
   matter and cerebrospinal fluid, the mean global signal, and quadratic and derivative expansions
   of these signals.
   * `Reference 1 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22926292>`_
   * `Reference 2 <https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/23994314>`_
 * Anatomical component-based correction (``aCompCor``) identifies sources of signal variance in
   white matter and cerebrospinal fluid using principal component analysis (PCA).
   A sufficient number of signals to explain 50 percent of variance in white matter and
   cerebrospinal fluid are included in the denoising model, as are motion estimates and their
   derivatives. Global signal regression can be enabled (``aCompCor50+gsr``) or disabled
   (``aCompCor50``).
   * [Reference 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17560126)
   * [Reference 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/24657780)
 * ICA-AROMA (``aroma``) identifies sources of variance across the brain using independent component
   analysis (ICA), and then uses a heuristic to classify each source as either noise or signal of
   interest. Noise sources are included in the denoising model along with mean signal from white
   matter and CSF. Global signal regression can be enabled (``aroma+gsr``) or disabled (``aroma``).
   * *Note that the ``aroma`` streams do not strictly follow the original implementation of
     ICA-AROMA.* For a more faithful adaptation, see (smoothing documentation for the ``aroma``
     module).
   * [Reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/25770991)
 * The 24-parameter stream (`24P`) is never recommended, as previous investigations have not found
   it to perform well.
   * [Reference 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/28302591)
   * [Reference 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/29278773)
 * All streams can be supplemented with despiking or framewise censoring.
   * [Reference 1](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/17490845)
   * [Reference 2](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22019881)

Note that ``aroma`` and ``acompcor`` must have been performed during your preprocessing in
``FMRIPREP``.

Processing routines
-----------------------

Demeaning & detrending
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: ``regress``

Deameaning and detrending removes the overall mean, as well as linear or polynomial trends, from
the functional time series.

Censoring or despiking
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`regress`

Censoring uses criteria such as motion estimates and signal fluctuations to flag volumes likely to
be contaminated by noise, and then removes those volumes from the time series entirely. Despike
uses AFNI's ``3dDespike`` tool to identify signal outliers on a voxelwise basis and then
interpolates over those outliers.

Mean WM / CSF signal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`confound`

Variance in the white matter and cerebrospinal fluid compartments is typically not of interest in
studies of functional connectivity. Thus, the mean signal from WM and CSF can be included in the
denoising model.

Mean global signal
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`confound`

Regression of the global signal is uniquely effective in removing widespread effects of motion and
other spatially nonspecific artifacts from a functional time series.

[Reference](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15110027)

Mathematical expansions
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`confound`

Temporal derivatives and quadratic expansions are used to model delayed or nonlinear signal
fluctuations attributable to artifact.

Temporal filter
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`regress`

A temporal filter removes frequencies of no interest from the functional time series. Functional
connectivity is typically driven by synchrony among low-frequency signals, so temporal filters
often remove higher frequencies.

Spatial smoothing
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`regress`

Spatial smoothing mitigates noise at the voxel level by enforcing spatial autocorrelation among
adjacent voxels. By the same token, however, spatial smoothing also effectively reduces image
resolution. For each selected kernel size, the pipeline will produce derivatives with that level of
smoothing.

Functional networks
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`fcon`, :ref:`net`

Functional network analysis extracts mean signals from each region of a brain atlas and then
estimates the degree of synchrony between each pair of regions. Functional network analysis
generates a whole-brain graph; each atlas region is a node of this graph, while each synchrony
estimate is an edge. Modeling the brain as a graph allows for the use of analytic tools from graph
theory.

Seed-based correlation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`seed`

Seed-based correlation analysis computes the mean signal in a region of interest (the *seed*) and
then computes the synchrony (typically operationalized as Pearson correlation) between this signal
and the signal time series in each voxel.

Regional homogeneity
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`reho`

Regional homogeneity, or ReHo, is a measure of local uniformity in the BOLD signal, operationalized
as Kendall's W among each voxel and all other voxels in its neighborhood.

ALFF
~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`alff`

ALFF is an index of the Amplitude of Low-Frequency Fluctuations in the BOLD signal.

Regional quantification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`roiquant`

Regional quantification converts voxelwise derivative maps (for instance, ReHo and ALFF estimates)
into regional values based on any number of provided parcellations.

Quality assessment
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

*Module*: :ref:`qcfc`

Several indices of image quality are computed during functional connectivity processing at both
subject and group levels.
