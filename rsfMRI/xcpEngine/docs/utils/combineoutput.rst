.. _combineoutput:

Combine output files 
======================

The ``xcpEgine`` provides a standalone script that help users to assemble results from each subject 
and combine to a single file for further analysis in any other platform such as Excel, MATLAB or SPSS.
There is ``${XCPEDIR}/utils/combineOutput`` that combine inidcated file from all the subject in the output 
directory. This can be  very important to assemble  especially quality control file (`/{prefix}_quality.csv`)
and ``roiquant`` outputs ::
  
   ${XCPEDIR}/utils/combineOutput \
   -p $outputdir  \  # all subjects directory  after running xcpEngine
   -f "*quality.csv" \  # the extention of the file users want to combine
   -o XCP_QAVARS.csv  # the output file in csv 


The output file will consist of the header and  the all subjects correposnding value::

    id1,id2,relMeanRMSMotion,nSpikesRMS,nSpikesFD,nSpikesDV,relMaxRMSMotion
