.. _qcfcDistanceDependence:

QCFC Distance Dependence
========================

Distance-dependence of QC-FC measures.

``qcfcDistanceDependence`` computes the distance-dependence of QC-FC relationships previously
estimated using ``qcfc``. (Although it was designed for diagnosing the distance-dependent profile
of motion artefact, ``qcfcDistanceDependence`` can be used to compute the distance-dependence of
any edgewise measure.)

``qcfcDistanceDependence`` executes in the following order, using its inputs as follows:

 1. Read in the atlas specified by the ``-a`` flag.
 2. Call ``cmass`` to estimate the centre of mass of each node in the atlas.
 3. Call ``distmat`` to estimate the pairwise Euclidean distance between nodal centers of mass,
    saving the output as a distance matrix to the path specified by the argument to ``-d``.
 4. Correlate the computed pairwise distances with the test values provided as an argument to
    ``-q``, saving the overall correlation to the path specified by the argument to ``-o``.
 5. Plot a cloud of edgewise values with the Euclidean distance on the abscissa and with the test
    value on the ordinate; write the plot to the path specified by the argument to ``-f``.

Output
---------

 * The distance-dependence of provided test values, defined as the edgewise correlation
   coefficient between the test values and Euclidean distance (specified by argument to ``-o``).
 * A matrix of internodal Euclidean distances (specified by argument to ``-d``).
 * A plot of the relationship between test values and Euclidean distances (specified by argument
   to ``-f``).

Input arguments

Running from Docker:::
  
  docker run --rm -it --entrypoint \
  /xcpEngine/utils/qcfcDistanceDependence \
    pennbbl/xcpengine:latest \
    â€“a <atlas> \
    -q <test values> \
    -o <output path> \
    [-d <output distance matrix> -f <output correlation plot> -i <intermediate output>]


Optional arguments are denoted in square brackets ([]).

``-a``: Atlas
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
The atlas over which inter-nodal distances should be computed. This atlas should also have been
used to define the test values.

``-q``: Test values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A file containing an edgewise vector of values to evaluate for distance-dependence. Often, these
will be the QC-FC estimates produced by the ``qcfc`` utility.

``-o``: Output
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The path where the overall correlation coefficient between distance and test values should be
saved.

``-d``: Distance matrix
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The path where the matrix of distances between each pair of nodes in the provided atlas (argument
to ``-a``) is saved.

``-f``: Save correlation plot
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The path where the scatter plot of edgewise distance and test values will be saved. If ``ggplot2``
and ``reshape2`` are not installed, then the plot is automatically disabled.

``-i``: Intermediate output path
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A path where ``erodespare`` stores temporary files. If your machine or file system has a designated
space for temporary files (e.g., ``/tmp``), then using this space can substantially improve I/O
speed. Note, if running through Docker or Singularity your directories will need to be mounted
correctly.
