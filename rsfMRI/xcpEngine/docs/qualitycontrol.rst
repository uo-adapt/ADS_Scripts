===================================
 The quality control measures (prefix_quality.csv) 

Coregsitration of Functional and T1w:: 
         - coregCrossCorr - cross correlation  
         - CoregJaccard - Jaccard index 
         - CoregDice - Dice index 
         - CoregCoverage - Coverage index 

Registration of T1w to Template: 
         - regCrossCorr - cross correlation 
         - regJaccard - Jaccard index 
         - regDice - Dice index
         - regCoverage - Coverage index

Normalization of T1w/Functional to Template:
         - normCrossCorr - cross correlation 
         - normJaccard - Jaccard index 
         - normDice - Dice index
         - normCoverage - Coverage index

         - nSpikesFD - number of spikes per FD 
         - nspikesDV - number of spikes per DV 
         - pctSpikesDV - percentage of spikes per DV 
         - pctSpikesFD - percentage of spikes per FD 
         - meanDV - mead DVARS 

regression summary.::
