======================== Checking Inputs =============================



Error: Unable to load /projects/adapt_lab/shared/ADS/Scripts/rsfMRI/xcpEngine/rest_cohort.csv..csv,/projects/adapt_lab/shared/ADS/Scripts/rsfMRI/xcpEngine/rest_cohort.csv..csv, which was specified for option -c

Check that /projects/adapt_lab/shared/ADS/Scripts/rsfMRI/xcpEngine/rest_cohort.csv..csv,/projects/adapt_lab/shared/ADS/Scripts/rsfMRI/xcpEngine exists and you have permission to read it.
If you are using Docker or Singularity, make sure that /projects/adapt_lab/shared/ADS/Scripts/rsfMRI/xcpEngine/rest_cohort.csv..csv,/projects/adapt_lab/shared/ADS/Scripts/rsfMRI/xcpEngine
is correctly mounted and you can access it from within the container.

Remember that this path does not use the ``-r`` argument, but is a full
path to the file.

If using a container, you may find the documentation helpful for
interactively checking whether a file is accessible from within a
container (https://xcpengine.readthedocs.io/containers/index.html).

Your inputs would result in a failed pipeline. Exiting.
